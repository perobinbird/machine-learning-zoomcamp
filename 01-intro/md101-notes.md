## Code Snippets I Want to Remember

**Key rules**:
- Put the closing ``` on its own line (no spaces before it).
- Add an empty line after the closing ``` (recommended for clean rendering on GitHub).
- Then write your normal text — it won't be "pythonized" anymore.

**Wrong** (what might be happening to you):
```python
# Example
print("hi")
```  ← closing triple backticks must be alone on the line! (this line makes ``` not effective)
This text is still inside the code block!
Let us close it
```
Okay!
